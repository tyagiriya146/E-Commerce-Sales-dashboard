* I have extensively analyzed Year-to-Date (YTD) sales figures, which help us understand the cumulative sales performance from the beginning of the year until the present.
* I have been deeply involved in Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons, which allow us to compare current sales data with the corresponding period in the previous year, giving us a clear picture of growth or decline.
